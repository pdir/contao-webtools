# contao-webtools
pdir webtools for contao web development

## Features in this bundle
- **provides a slightly modified** version of the dump() function called pdump() which produces dump output only when the system is in dev mode: APP_ENV=dev. This should curb unwanted or forgotten dumps() somewhat.
- **specifies an additional key** in the query string to delete the assets/css folder from the frontend.
